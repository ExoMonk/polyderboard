# Poly Dearboard

[![rindexer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-rindexer-6C5CE7)](https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer)

On-chain Polymarket leaderboard built from ground-truth trade data.
Indexes `OrderFilled` events directly from the CTF Exchange and NegRisk Exchange contracts on Polygon — no reliance on Polymarket's API for trade data.

## Features

**Leaderboard** — Rank traders by mark-to-market PnL, volume, or trade count. Scatter chart visualizes efficiency (Return on Volume %) vs performance.

**Trader Detail** — Per-trader stats, open positions valued at live market prices, trade activity chart, and full trade history.

**Hot Markets** — Most active markets by volume (1h / 24h / 7d) with category tags and trader counts.

**Market Live Feed** — Per-market real-time trade feed with Yes/No outcome display and price bars.

**Alerting system** — Real-time onchain alerting on whale trades, resolutions and reverted settlments

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Indexer | [rindexer](https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer) (no-code mode) |
| Storage | ClickHouse (columnar OLAP) |
| Normalization | ClickHouse materialized views |
| API | Rust / Axum |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript + Recharts + Tailwind |
| Chain | Polygon (chain_id: 137) |

## Architecture

```
Polygon (2s blocks)
  ↓ eth_getLogs
rindexer no-code indexer
  ↓ raw events
ClickHouse (OrderFilled, PayoutRedemption tables)
  ↓ materialized views
ClickHouse (normalized trades: trader, side, asset, price, amount)
  ↓ CTE queries
Axum REST API ← React frontend
```

## PnL Methodology

Uses **mark-to-market** PnL rather than pure cash-flow:

```
PnL = sum_per_asset(cash_flow + net_tokens × latest_market_price)
```

This values open positions at the current market price, producing meaningful PnL even with a partial indexing window. Closed positions (net_tokens = 0) reduce to pure cash-flow PnL.

**Known limitation**: Market resolution redemptions (`PayoutRedemption` events) are not included in PnL because the event lacks an `asset_id` field, making per-position matching impossible without deriving token IDs from `keccak256(parentCollectionId, conditionId, indexSet)`. Mark-to-market approximates this well since winning tokens trade near $1.00 before resolution.

## Run

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make indexer` | Starts ClickHouse + rindexer |
| `make live` | Starts from current block (no backfill) |
| `FROM=80000000 make backfill` | Backfills from block to first indexed block |
| `make serve` | Starts the Axum API on port 3001 |
| `make query` | Runs E2E leaderboard queries |
| `make clean` | Tears down Docker containers + volumes |
| `make frontend` | Runs Polydearboard frontend |
